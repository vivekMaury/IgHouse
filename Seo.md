## END OF USER BLOCK

You are a senior SEO engineer and full-stack developer.
Your job is to make this SaaS website fully SEO-ready — 
technically correct, properly indexed, and social-share friendly.


Do not ask questions. Detect the stack first, then implement everything.


---


## STEP 1 — DETECT TECH STACK


Read the codebase carefully and identify exactly which setup this is:


**Option A — Next.js App Router (has /app directory)**
→ Uses: export const metadata in each page.tsx/page.jsx
→ Root metadata in: /app/layout.tsx


**Option B — Next.js Pages Router (has /pages directory)**
→ Uses: next/head component inside each page
→ Custom document: /pages/_document.tsx


**Option C — React (CRA or Vite, no SSR)**
→ Uses: index.html as the single HTML file
→ Meta tags in <head> of index.html are static — they don't change per page
→ Needs: react-helmet-async for dynamic per-page meta tags


**Option D — Vue.js**
→ Uses: @vueuse/head or vue-meta for dynamic meta


**Option E — Plain HTML**
→ Meta tags go directly in each HTML file's <head>


State which option this codebase is before proceeding.
If it is Option C (React SPA), install react-helmet-async immediately:
npm install react-helmet-async


---


## STEP 2 — IMPLEMENT META TAGS


### For Option A (Next.js App Router):


In /app/layout.tsx, add the root-level metadata export:


export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: {
    default: 'DEFAULT_TITLE',
    template: '%s | SITE_NAME'
  },
  description: 'DEFAULT_DESCRIPTION',
  metadataBase: new URL('SITE_URL'),
  alternates: {
    canonical: '/'
  },
  openGraph: {
    type: 'website',
    locale: 'SITE_LANGUAGE',
    url: 'SITE_URL',
    siteName: 'SITE_NAME',
    title: 'DEFAULT_TITLE',
    description: 'DEFAULT_DESCRIPTION',
    images: [{ url: 'DEFAULT_OG_IMAGE', width: 1200, height: 630, alt: 'SITE_NAME' }]
  },
  twitter: {
    card: 'summary_large_image',
    title: 'DEFAULT_TITLE',
    description: 'DEFAULT_DESCRIPTION',
    creator: 'TWITTER_HANDLE',
    images: ['DEFAULT_OG_IMAGE']
  },
  robots: {
    index: true,
    follow: true,
    googleBot: { index: true, follow: true }
  }
}


Then for every individual page.tsx that exists, add a unique metadata 
export with a specific title and description relevant to that page's content.
Scan all pages and write unique metadata for each one.


### For Option B (Next.js Pages Router):


Create a reusable SEO component at /components/SEO.tsx:
- Accepts: title, description, canonicalUrl, ogImage as props
- Uses next/head to inject all meta tags
- Has sensible defaults from the user block above


Import and use this SEO component at the top of every page in /pages/.
Write a unique title and description for each page based on its content.


### For Option C (React SPA with react-helmet-async):


In main.tsx or index.tsx, wrap the app with <HelmetProvider>


Create a reusable SEO component at /src/components/SEO.tsx:
- Uses Helmet from react-helmet-async
- Accepts: title, description, canonicalUrl, ogImage
- Sets all open graph, twitter card, and standard meta tags


In index.html, add this inside <head> as the static base:
- viewport meta (if missing)
- charset UTF-8 (if missing)
- Default title as fallback


Use the SEO component at the top of every route/page component.
Write unique title and description for each page.


Important note for React SPA:
Add a comment in index.html:
<!-- NOTE: This React SPA uses client-side rendering. For full SEO 
indexing, consider migrating to Next.js or using prerendering. 
Google can crawl client-rendered pages but social media crawlers 
(Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp) cannot execute JavaScript — 
your og:image and og:title will not show on social shares unless 
you use SSR, prerendering, or a service like prerender.io -->


---


## STEP 3 — ROBOTS.TXT


Check if /public/robots.txt exists.
If not, create it:


User-agent: *
Allow: /
Disallow: /api/
Disallow: /dashboard/
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /account/
Sitemap: SITE_URL/sitemap.xml


Adjust the Disallow paths based on what private/authenticated 
routes actually exist in this codebase.


---


## STEP 4 — SITEMAP


Check if a sitemap exists. If not:


### For Next.js App Router:
Create /app/sitemap.ts that exports a sitemap function.
It should return all public pages (home, pricing, about, blog, etc.)
with lastModified as today's date and changeFrequency and priority set.


### For Next.js Pages Router:
Create /pages/sitemap.xml.tsx that generates XML dynamically.


### For React SPA:
Create /public/sitemap.xml manually with all public route URLs.
Add a comment that this must be updated manually when new pages are added.


---


## STEP 5 — CANONICAL TAGS


Every page must have a canonical URL tag.
This prevents duplicate content issues.


For Next.js App Router: alternates.canonical is already set in Step 2.
For Pages Router and React: add <link rel="canonical" href="FULL_PAGE_URL"> 
inside the SEO component and pass the correct URL to each page.


---


## STEP 6 — STRUCTURED DATA (JSON-LD)


Add JSON-LD structured data for the following:


### On the Homepage:
Add WebSite schema with name, url, and potentialAction (SearchAction if search exists)
Add Organization schema with name, url, logo, contactPoint (using SUPPORT info if available)


### On the Pricing Page (if it exists):
Add Product or Offer schema for each plan with name, description, price, priceCurrency


Inject JSON-LD using:
- Next.js: <script type="application/ld+json"> inside the page's metadata or a Script tag
- React: inject using react-helmet-async with a dangerouslySetInnerHTML script tag


---


## STEP 7 — SEMANTIC HTML AUDIT


Scan all pages and fix:
- Every page must have exactly ONE <h1> tag
- Heading hierarchy must be correct: h1 → h2 → h3 (no skipping levels)
- Images must have descriptive alt text (not empty, not "image", not filename)
- Links must have descriptive text (not "click here" or "read more" without context)
- Buttons must have accessible labels
- Main content area should be wrapped in <main> tag
- Nav should use <nav> tag
- Footer should use <footer> tag


Fix every violation found.


---


## STEP 8 — PAGE SPEED BASICS


Check and fix these common performance issues that affect SEO:


- Images: if using <img> tags in Next.js, replace with next/image
- Fonts: if Google Fonts are loaded via <link>, add preconnect tags
- Ensure no render-blocking scripts in <head> without defer or async
- If any large third-party script is loaded, add loading="lazy" or defer

## STEP 9 — FINAL REPORT


Output this after completing all steps:
